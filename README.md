## Overview

Omnifood is a product based on creating meals using AI.

## My process

- I took a desktop-first approach as the mobile design wasn't provided
- Wrote the HTML section by section
- Stylized the CSS after each section was created
- Adapted as I progressed
- Used a lot of contrast checkers to create a pleasing visual experience
- Used JavaScript for the mobile menu and background effects

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
